# Vulnerability Assessment
### What is a vulnerability assessment?
A process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system, network, or application. It helps to find the weaknesses and risks that could be exploited by attackers. A vulnerability assessment can be done manually or using automated tools. An example of a vulnerability assessment tool is Nessus.
### CVE
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, a standardized list of publicly known security vulnerabilities and exposures. Each CVE entry has a unique identifier, a description, a severity score, and references to related sources. CVE helps to facilitate the sharing and communication of vulnerability information among different parties. An example of a CVE entry is CVE-2022-21907, which affects Microsoft IIS Web Server.
### Exploit-DB
An online archive of exploits and proof-of-concepts for various vulnerabilities. It provides the source code, binaries, or instructions for exploiting the vulnerabilities. Exploit-DB is maintained by Offensive Security, the creators of Kali Linux and Metasploit. An example of an exploit from Exploit-DB is Apache Struts 2 - Remote Code Execution (CVE-2018-11776).
### NIST Database
A collection of databases and tools maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that provide information on various aspects of cybersecurity, such as standards, guidelines, best practices, vulnerabilities, test results, and benchmarks. Some of the NIST databases are National Vulnerability Database (NVD), Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), and National Checklist Program (NCP).
### Nmap Scripts
Scripts that extend the functionality of Nmap, a popular network scanning and discovery tool. Nmap scripts can perform various tasks, such as service detection, vulnerability scanning, brute force attacks, banner grabbing, and more. Nmap scripts are written in Lua and use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). An example of a Nmap script is http-vuln-cve2020-28017-through-28026-21nails.nse, which checks for Exim mailserver vulnerabilities.
### Metasploit
A framework for developing and executing exploits for various vulnerabilities. Metasploit provides a library of modules, payloads, encoders, and tools that can be used to create custom exploits or use existing ones. Metasploit can also perform post-exploitation tasks, such as privilege escalation, persistence, pivoting, and more. An example of a Metasploit module is windows/http/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl_rce.rb, which exploits CVE-2017-7269 on Microsoft IIS Web Server.
### Nessus
A commercial vulnerability scanner can perform comprehensive scans on various systems, networks, and applications. Nessus can detect thousands of vulnerabilities across different platforms and technologies. Nessus can also perform compliance checks, configuration audits, malware detection, web application scanning, and more. An example of a Nessus scan result is shown below:
