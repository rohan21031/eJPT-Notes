# Host & Network Auditing

-   **Auditing**: A process of evaluating the security posture, compliance, and performance of a system, network, or application. It helps to verify the effectiveness of the security controls, policies, and procedures that are in place. An auditing process typically involves the following steps:
    
    -   Start by interviews: Interview the stakeholders, administrators, users, and other relevant parties to gather information about the system, network, or application, its purpose, functions, features, requirements, risks, and challenges.
    -   Review paperwork: Review the documentation, reports, logs, records, and evidence that are related to the system, network, or application, such as configuration files, security policies, incident reports, audit trails, etc.
    -   Assessments: Use various tools and techniques to perform assessments on the system, network, or application, such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, configuration auditing, performance testing, etc. Some examples of assessment tools are Nessus, SolarWinds, Nmap, Metasploit, etc.
    -   Take good notes: Take detailed and accurate notes of the findings, observations, recommendations, and suggestions that are derived from the interviews, reviews, and assessments. Use tools that can help organize and manage the notes effectively, such as Joplin, Sublime Text, OneNote, etc.
    -   Mind map: Create a visual representation of the notes that show the relationships and connections among the different aspects of the system, network, or application. Use tools that can help create and edit mind maps easily, such as XMind, MindMeister, Coggle, etc.
    -   Reports: Prepare a formal report that summarizes the results and outcomes of the auditing process. The report should include an executive summary, an introduction, a methodology section, a findings section, a conclusion section, and an appendix section. The report should also provide recommendations and suggestions for improvement.
-   **Tools for Auditing**:
    
    -   Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): A set of standards and specifications that enable automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation of systems. SCAP consists of several components that define how to express and measure security-related information in a standardized way. Some examples of SCAP components are Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF), Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL), etc.
    -   Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs): A collection of guidelines and best practices for securing various systems and technologies. STIGs provide detailed instructions on how to configure and harden systems to meet specific security requirements and standards. STIGs are developed and maintained by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for the Department of Defense (DoD). STIGs can be applied manually or using automated tools such as SCAP Compliance Checker (SCC) or STIG Viewer.
    -   Local Group Policy Object (LGPO): A command-line tool that can be used to apply local group policy settings to Windows systems. LGPO tool can create or modify local group policy objects (LGPOs) based on the registry.pol files or text files that contain registry settings. LGPO tool can also export or import LGPOs from or to other systems. LGPO tool can be useful for applying security settings to standalone or non-domain-joined systems that do not receive group policy settings from a domain controller.
    -   Nmap: A powerful tool for network exploration and security auditing. Nmap can perform various tasks such as host discovery, port scanning, service detection, version detection, operating system detection, vulnerability scanning, firewall evasion, script execution, and more. Nmap can also use Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts to extend its functionality and perform custom tasks. Nmap can be used for asset management by discovering and inventorying the devices on a network.
    -   Nessus: A commercial vulnerability scanner that can perform comprehensive scans on various systems, networks, and applications. Nessus can detect thousands of vulnerabilities across different platforms and technologies. Nessus can also perform compliance checks, configuration audits, malware detection, web application scanning, and more. Nessus can be used for vulnerability assessment by identifying and prioritizing the weaknesses and risks that could be exploited by attackers.
