# Windows File System Vulnerabilities 
### Alternate Data Streams
- is a NTFS(New Technology File System) file attribute
- any file created on an NTFS format
	- Data stream - contains the data
	- Resources stream - contains metadata - when the file was created, by whom, ...
- attackers can use ADS to hide malicious code in legitimate files
- can be stored on the Resource stream of the legitimate file
- great way of hiding code on a legitimate file
- **demonstration process - example**
	- on windows system
	- create a text file on Temp (or any directory)
	- right click on file and see the properties - details
	- the details the Resource stream that we can hide malicious code
	- open cmd
	- `$ notepad test.txt:secret.txt`
	- type inside the file, this is hidden, or anything you wish to 
	- the file is empty - intersting
	- open the test and type this is visible
- using cmd we can see that we have the content of secret.txt using notepad test.txt:secret.txt
- that is how you can use the ADS to evade the Antivirus
